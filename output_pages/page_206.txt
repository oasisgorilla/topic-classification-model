If we plot the number of transistors in the different Intel processors versus the year of introduction, and
use a logarithmic scale for the y-axis, we can see that the growth has been phenomenal. Fitting a line
through the data, we see that the number of transistors increases at an annual rate of approximately
37%, meaning that the number of transistors doubles about every 26 months. This growth has been
sustained over the multiple-decade history of x86 microprocessors.
In 1965, Gordon Moore, a founder of Intel Corporation, extrapolated from the chip technology of
the day (by which they could fabricate circuits with around 64 transistors on a single chip) to predict
that the number of transistors per chip would double every year for the next 10 years. This prediction
became known as Moore’s Law. As it turns out, his prediction was just a little bit optimistic, but also too
short-sighted. Over more than 50 years, the semiconductor industry has been able to double transistor
counts on average every 18 months.
Similar exponential growth rates have occurred for other aspects of computer technology, including
the storage capacities of magnetic disks and semiconductor memories. These remarkable growth rates
have been the major driving forces of the computer revolution.
with the introduction of SSE2. Although we see vestiges of the historical evolu-
tion of x86 in x86-64 programs, many of the most arcane features of x86 do not
appear.

Suppose we write a C program as two ﬁles p1.c and p2.c. We can then compile
this code using a Unix command line:
