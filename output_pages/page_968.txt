Origins of the Internet
The Internet is one of the most successful examples of government, university, and industry partnership.
Many factors contributed to its success, but we think two are particularly important: a sustained 30-
year investment by the United States government and a commitment by passionate researchers to what
Dave Clarke at MIT has dubbed “rough consensus and working code.”
The seeds of the Internet were sown in 1957, when, at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet
Union shocked the world by launching Sputnik, the ﬁrst artiﬁcial earth satellite. In response, the United
States government created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), whose charter was to
reestablish the US lead in science and technology. In 1967, Lawrence Roberts at ARPA published
plans for a new network called the ARPANET. The ﬁrst ARPANET nodes were up and running by
1969. By 1971, there were 13 ARPANET nodes, and email had emerged as the ﬁrst important network
application.
In 1972, Robert Kahn outlined the general principles of internetworking: a collection of intercon-
nected networks, with communication between the networks handled independently on a “best-effort
basis” by black boxes called “routers.” In 1974, Kahn and Vinton Cerf published the ﬁrst details of
TCP/IP
, which by 1982 had become the standard internetworking protocol for ARPANET. On January
1, 1983, every node on the ARPANET switched to TCP/IP
, marking the birth of the global IP Internet.
In 1985, Paul Mockapetris invented DNS, and there were over 1,000 Internet hosts. The next year,
the National Science Foundation (NSF) built the NSFNET backbone connecting 13 sites with 56 Kb/s
phone lines. It was upgraded to 1.5 Mb/s T1 links in 1988 and 45 Mb/s T3 links in 1991. By 1988, there
were more than 50,000 hosts. In 1989, the original ARPANET was ofﬁcially retired. In 1995, when there
were almost 10,000,000 Internet hosts, NSF retired NSFNET and replaced it with the modern Internet
architecture based on private commercial backbones connected by public network access points.
