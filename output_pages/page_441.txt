SEQ Stage Implementations
In this section, we devise HCL descriptions for the control logic blocks required
to implement SEQ. A complete HCL description for SEQ is given in Web Aside
arch:hcl on page 508. We show some example blocks here, and others are given as
practice problems. We recommend that you work these problems as a way to check
your understanding of how the blocks relate to the computational requirements
of the different instructions.
Part of the HCL description of SEQ that we do not include here is a deﬁnition
of the different integer and Boolean signals that can be used as arguments to the
HCL operations. These include the names of the different hardware signals, as
well as constant values for the different instruction codes, function codes, register
names, ALU operations, and status codes. Only those that must be explicitly

encodings of the instructions, function codes, register IDs, ALU operations, and status
codes.
