Origins of the sockets interface
The original sockets interface was developed by researchers at University of California, Berkeley, in
the early 1980s. For this reason, it is often referred to as Berkeley sockets. The Berkeley researchers
developed the sockets interface to work with any underlying protocol. The ﬁrst implementation was
for TCP/IP
, which they included in the Unix 4.2BSD kernel and distributed to numerous universities
and labs. This was an important event in Internet history. Almost overnight, thousands of people had
access to TCP/IP and its source codes. It generated tremendous excitement and sparked a ﬂurry of new
research in networking and internetworking.

The Sockets Interface
The sockets interface is a set of functions that are used in conjunction with the Unix
I/O functions to build network applications. It has been implemented on most
modern systems, including all Unix variants as well as Windows and Macintosh
systems. Figure 11.12 gives an overview of the sockets interface in the context of a
typical client-server transaction. You should use this picture as a road map when
we discuss the individual functions.
