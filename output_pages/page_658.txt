0) from block[0] of the newly fetched cache line.

2. Read word at address 1. This is a cache hit. The cache immediately returns
m[1] from block[1] of the cache line. The state of the cache does not change.
3. Read word at address 13. Since the cache line in set 2 is not valid, this is a
cache miss. The cache loads block 6 into set 2 and returns m[13] from block[1]
of the new cache line.

4. Read word at address 8. This is a miss. The cache line in set 0 is indeed valid,
but the tags do not match. The cache loads block 4 into set 0 (replacing the
line that was there from the read of address 0) and returns m[8] from block[0]
of the new cache line.

5. Read word at address 0. This is another miss, due to the unfortunate fact
that we just replaced block 0 during the previous reference to address 8. This
kind of miss, where we have plenty of room in the cache but keep alternating
references to blocks that map to the same set, is an example of a conï¬‚ict miss.
