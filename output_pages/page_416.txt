Four-way multiplexor.
The different combinations
of control signals s1 and
s0 determine which data
input is transmitted to the
output.

!s0
: C; # 10

: D; # 11
];
The comments on the right (any text starting with # and running for the rest of
the line is a comment) show which combination of s1 and s0 will cause the case to
be selected. Observe that the selection expressions can sometimes be simpliﬁed,
since only the ﬁrst matching case is selected. For example, the second expression
can be written !s1
, rather than the more complete !s1&& s0, since the only other
possibility having s1 equal to 0 was given as the ﬁrst selection expression. Similarly,
the third expression can be written as !s0, while the fourth can simply be written
as 1.
As a ﬁnal example, suppose we want to design a logic circuit that ﬁnds the
minimum value among a set of words A, B, and C, diagrammed as follows:
C
B
A
MIN3
Min3
We can express this using an HCL case expression as
word Min3 = [
A <= B && A <= C : A;
B <= A && B <= C : B;
1
: C;
];
Practice Problem 4.11 (solution page 520)
The HCL code given for computing the minimum of three words contains four
comparison expressions of the form X <= Y. Rewrite the code to compute the
same result, but using only three comparisons.
