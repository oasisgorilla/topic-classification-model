Practice Problem 2.51 (solution page 195)
We saw in Problem 2.46 that the Patriot missile software approximated 0.1 as x =
0.000110011001100110011002. Suppose instead that they had used IEEE round-
to-even mode to determine an approximation x′ to 0.1 with 23 bits to the right of
the binary point.
A. What is the binary representation of x′?
B. What is the approximate decimal value of x′ −0.1?
C. How far off would the computed clock have been after 100 hours of opera-
tion?
D. How far off would the program’s prediction of the position of the Scud
missile have been?
Practice Problem 2.52 (solution page 196)
Consider the following two 7-bit ﬂoating-point representations based on the IEEE
ﬂoating-point format. Neither has a sign bit—they can only represent nonnegative
numbers.
1. Format A
There are k = 3 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 3.
There are n = 4 fraction bits.
2. Format B
There are k = 4 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 7.
There are n = 3 fraction bits.
Below, you are given some bit patterns in format A, and your task is to convert
them to the closest value in format B. If necessary, you should apply the round-to-
even rounding rule. In addition, give the values of numbers given by the format A
and format B bit patterns. Give these as whole numbers (e.g., 17) or as fractions
(e.g., 17/64).

Floating-Point Operations
The IEEE standard speciﬁes a simple rule for determining the result of an arith-
metic operation such as addition or multiplication. Viewing ﬂoating-point values x
