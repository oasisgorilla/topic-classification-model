How much is a gigabyte?
Unfortunately, the meanings of preﬁxes such as kilo (K), mega (M), giga (G), and tera (T) depend
on the context. For measures that relate to the capacity of DRAMs and SRAMs, typically K = 210,
M = 220, G = 230, and T = 240. For measures related to the capacity of I/O devices such as disks and
networks, typically K = 103, M = 106, G = 109, and T = 1012. Rates and throughputs usually use these
preﬁx values as well.
Fortunately, for the back-of-the-envelope estimates that we typically rely on, either assumption
works ﬁne in practice. For example, the relative difference between 230 and 109 is not that large:
(230 −109)/109 ≈7%. Similarly, (240 −1012)/1012 ≈10%.
when areal densities were relatively low. However, as areal densities increased,
the gaps between sectors (where no data bits were stored) became unacceptably
large. Thus, modern high-capacity disks use a technique known as multiple zone
recording, where the set of cylinders is partitioned into disjoint subsets known as
recording zones. Each zone consists of a contiguous collection of cylinders. Each
track in each cylinder in a zone has the same number of sectors, which is deter-
mined by the number of sectors that can be packed into the innermost track of
the zone.
The capacity of a disk is given by the following formula:
Capacity = # bytes
sector × average # sectors
track
× # tracks
surface × # surfaces
platter
× # platters
disk
For example, suppose we have a disk with ﬁve platters, 512 bytes per sector, 20,000
tracks per surface, and an average of 300 sectors per track. Then the capacity of
the disk is
Capacity = 512 bytes
sector
× 300 sectors
track
× 20,000 tracks
surface
× 2 surfaces
platter
× 5 platters
disk
= 30,720,000,000 bytes
= 30.72 GB
Notice that manufacturers express disk capacity in units of gigabytes (GB) or
terabytes (TB), where 1 GB = 109 bytes and 1 TB = 1012 bytes.
Practice Problem 6.2 (solution page 697)
What is the capacity of a disk with 3 platters, 15,000 cylinders, an average of 500
sectors per track, and 1,024 bytes per sector?
Disk Operation
Disks read and write bits stored on the magnetic surface using a read/write head
connected to the end of an actuator arm, as shown in Figure 6.10(a). By moving
