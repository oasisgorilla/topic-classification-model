A second function of denormalized numbers is to represent numbers that are
very close to 0.0. They provide a property known as gradual underﬂow in which
possible numeric values are spaced evenly near 0.0.
Case 3: Special Values
A ﬁnal category of values occurs when the exponent ﬁeld is all ones. When the
fraction ﬁeld is all zeros, the resulting values represent inﬁnity, either +∞when
s = 0 or −∞when s = 1. Inﬁnity can represent results that overﬂow, as when we
multiply two very large numbers, or when we divide by zero. When the fraction
ﬁeld is nonzero, the resulting value is called a NaN, short for “not a number.” Such
values are returned as the result of an operation where the result cannot be given
as a real number or as inﬁnity, as when computing
√
−1 or ∞−∞. They can also
be useful in some applications for representing uninitialized data.

Example Numbers
Figure 2.34 shows the set of values that can be represented in a hypothetical 6-bit
format having k = 3 exponent bits and n = 2 fraction bits. The bias is 23−1 −1 = 3.
Part (a) of the ﬁgure shows all representable values (other than NaN). The two
inﬁnities are at the extreme ends. The normalized numbers with maximum mag-
nitude are ±14. The denormalized numbers are clustered around 0. These can be
seen more clearly in part (b) of the ﬁgure, where we show just the numbers be-
tween −1.0 and +1.0. The two zeros are special cases of denormalized numbers.
Observe that the representable numbers are not uniformly distributed—they are
denser nearer the origin.
Figure 2.35 shows some examples for a hypothetical 8-bit ﬂoating-point for-
mat having k = 4 exponent bits and n = 3 fraction bits. The bias is 24−1 −1 = 7.
The ﬁgure is divided into three regions representing the three classes of numbers.
The different columns show how the exponent ﬁeld encodes the exponent E,
while the fraction ﬁeld encodes the signiﬁcand M, and together they form the
