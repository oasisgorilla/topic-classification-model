work to increase locality by automatically performing the kinds of manual code
transformations we discussed in Section 6.6 [22, 32, 66, 72, 79, 87, 119]. Carter
and colleagues have proposed a cache-aware memory controller [17]. Other re-
searchers have developed cache-oblivious algorithms that are designed to run well
without any explicit knowledge of the structure of the underlying cache mem-
ory [30, 38, 39, 9].
There is a large body of literature on building and using disk storage. Many
storage researchers look for ways to aggregate individual disks into larger, more
robust, and more secure storage pools [20, 40, 41, 83, 121]. Others look for ways
to use caches and locality to improve the performance of disk accesses [12, 21].
Systems such as Exokernel provide increased user-level control of disk and mem-
ory resources [57]. Systems such as the Andrew File System [78] and Coda [94]
extend the memory hierarchy across computer networks and mobile notebook
computers. Schindler and Ganger developed an interesting tool that automatically
characterizes the geometry and performance of SCSI disk drives [95]. Researchers
have investigated techniques for building and using ﬂash-based SSDs [8, 81].
Homework Problems
6.22 ◆◆
Suppose you are asked to design a rotating disk where the number of bits per
track is constant. You know that the number of bits per track is determined
by the circumference of the innermost track, which you can assume is also the
circumference of the hole. Thus, if you make the hole in the center of the disk
larger, the number of bits per track increases, but the total number of tracks
decreases. If you let r denote the radius of the platter, and x . r the radius of the
hole, what value of x maximizes the capacity of the disk?
