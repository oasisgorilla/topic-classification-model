Converting between decimal and hexadecimal
For converting larger values between decimal and hexadecimal, it is best to let a computer or calculator
do the work. There are numerous tools that can do this. One simple way is to use any of the standard
search engines, with queries such as
Convert 0xabcd to decimal
or
123 in hex
Decimal

0x75
0xBD

Practice Problem 2.4 (solution page 180)
Without converting the numbers to decimal or binary, try to solve the following
arithmetic problems, giving the answers in hexadecimal. Hint: Just modify the
methods you use for performing decimal addition and subtraction to use base 16.
A. 0x605c + 0x5 =
B. 0x605c −0x20 =
C. 0x605c + 32 =
D. 0x60fa −0x605c =

Data Sizes
Every computer has a word size, indicating the nominal size of pointer data. Since
a virtual address is encoded by such a word, the most important system parameter
determined by the word size is the maximum size of the virtual address space. That
is, for a machine with a w-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range from 0 to
2w −1, giving the program access to at most 2w bytes.
In recent years, there has been a widespread shift from machines with 32-
bit word sizes to those with word sizes of 64 bits. This occurred ﬁrst for high-end
machines designed for large-scale scientiﬁc and database applications, followed
by desktop and laptop machines, and most recently for the processors found in
smartphones. A 32-bit word size limits the virtual address space to 4 gigabytes
(written 4 GB), that is, just over 4 × 109 bytes. Scaling up to a 64-bit word size
leads to a virtual address space of 16 exabytes, or around 1.84 × 1019 bytes.
