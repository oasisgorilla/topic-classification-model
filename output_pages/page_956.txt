Client-server transactions versus database transactions
Client-server transactions are not database transactions and do not share any of their properties, such
as atomicity. In our context, a transaction is simply a sequence of steps carried out by a client and a
server.
4. The client receives the response and manipulates it. For example, after a Web
browser receives a page from the server, it displays it on the screen.
It is important to realize that clients and servers are processes and not ma-
chines, or hosts as they are often called in this context. A single host can run many
different clients and servers concurrently, and a client and server transaction can
be on the same or different hosts. The client-server model is the same, regardless
of the mapping of clients and servers to hosts.
11.2
Networks
Clients and servers often run on separate hosts and communicate using the hard-
ware and software resources of a computer network. Networks are sophisticated
systems, and we can only hope to scratch the surface here. Our aim is to give you
a workable mental model from a programmerâ€™s perspective.
To a host, a network is just another I/O device that serves as a source and sink
for data, as shown in Figure 11.2.
