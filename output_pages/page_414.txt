As is shown on the right side of Figure 4.12, we will draw word-level circuits
using medium-thickness lines to represent the set of wires carrying the individual
bits of the word, and we will show a single-bit signal as a dashed line.
Practice Problem 4.10 (solution page 520)
Suppose you want to implement a word-level equality circuit using the exclusive-
or circuits from Problem 4.9 rather than from bit-level equality circuits. Design
such a circuit for a 64-bit word consisting of 64 bit-level exclusive-or circuits and
two additional logic gates.
Figure 4.13 shows the circuit for a word-level multiplexor. This circuit gener-
ates a 64-bit word Out equal to one of the two input words, A or B, depending on
the control input bit s. The circuit consists of 64 identical subcircuits, each hav-
ing a structure similar to the bit-level multiplexor from Figure 4.11. Rather than
replicating the bit-level multiplexor 64 times, the word-level version reduces the
number of inverters by generating !s once and reusing it at each bit position.

Word-level multiplexor circuit. The output will equal input word A when
the control signal s is 1, and it will equal B otherwise. Multiplexors are described in HCL
using case expressions.
