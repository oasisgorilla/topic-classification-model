derivation: Expansion of a two’s-complement number by sign extension
Let w′ = w + k. What we want to prove is that
B2Tw+k([xw−1, . . . , xw−1

	

k times
, xw−1, xw−2, . . . , x0]) = B2Tw([xw−1, xw−2, . . . , x0])
The proof follows by induction on k. That is, if we can prove that sign extending
by 1 bit preserves the numeric value, then this property will hold when sign
extending by an arbitrary number of bits. Thus, the task reduces to proving that
B2Tw+1([xw−1, xw−1, xw−2, . . . , x0]) = B2Tw([xw−1, xw−2, . . . , x0])
Expanding the left-hand expression with Equation 2.3 gives the following:
B2Tw+1([xw−1, xw−1, xw−2, . . . , x0]) = −xw−12w +

The key property we exploit is that 2w −2w−1 = 2w−1. Thus, the combined effect
of adding a bit of weight −2w and of converting the bit having weight −2w−1 to be
one with weight 2w−1 is to preserve the original numeric value.
Practice Problem 2.22 (solution page 186)
Show that each of the following bit vectors is a two’s-complement representation
of −4 by applying Equation 2.3:
A. [1100]
B. [11100]
C. [111100]
Observe that the second and third bit vectors can be derived from the ﬁrst by sign
extension.
