Practice Problem 11.1 (solution page 1002)
Complete the following table:
Dotted-decimal address
Hex address
107.212.122.205
64.12.149.13
107.212.96.29
0x00000080
0xFFFFFF00
0x0A010140
Practice Problem 11.2 (solution page 1003)
Write a program hex2dd.c that converts its 16-bit hex argument to a 16-bit
network byte order and prints the result. For example
linux> ./hex2dd 0x400
1024
Practice Problem 11.3 (solution page 1003)
Write a program dd2hex.c that converts its 16-bit network byte order to a 16-bit
hex number and prints the result. For example,
linux> ./dd2hex 1024
0x400
11.3.2
Internet Domain Names
Internet clients and servers use IP addresses when they communicate with each
other. However, large integers are difﬁcult for people to remember, so the Internet
also deﬁnes a separate set of more human-friendly domain names, as well as a
mechanism that maps the set of domain names to the set of IP addresses. A domain
name is a sequence of words (letters, numbers, and dashes) separated by periods,
such as whaleshark.ics.cs.cmu.edu.
The set of domain names forms a hierarchy, and each domain name encodes
its position in the hierarchy. An example is the easiest way to understand this.
Figure 11.10 shows a portion of the domain name hierarchy.
The hierarchy is represented as a tree. The nodes of the tree represent domain
names that are formed by the path back to the root. Subtrees are referred to as sub-
domains. The ﬁrst level in the hierarchy is an unnamed root node. The next level
is a collection of ﬁrst-level domain names that are deﬁned by a nonproﬁt organi-
zation called ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).
Common ﬁrst-level domains include com, edu, gov, org, and net.
