PIPE decode and write-back stage logic. No instruction requires both valP and the value read
from register port A, and so these two can be merged to form the signal valA for later stages. The block labeled
“Sel+Fwd A” performs this task and also implements the forwarding logic for source operand valA. The block
labeled “Fwd B” implements the forwarding logic for source operand valB. The register write locations are
speciﬁed by the dstE and dstM signals from the write-back stage rather than from the decode stage, since it
is writing the results of the instruction currently in the write-back stage.
do not need the value read from the A port of the register ﬁle. This selection is
controlled by the icode signal for this stage. When signal D_icode matches the
instruction code for either call or jXX, this block should select D_valP as its
output.
As mentioned in Section 4.5.5, there are ﬁve different forwarding sources,
each with a data word and a destination register ID:
