Solution to Problem 8.8 (page 809)
This program prints the string 213, which is the shorthand name of the CS:APP
course at Carnegie Mellon. The parent starts by printing ‘2’, then forks the child,
which spins in an inﬁnite loop. The parent then sends a signal to the child and
waits for it to terminate. The child catches the signal (interrupting the inﬁnite
loop), decrements the counter (from an initial value of 2), prints ‘1’, and then
terminates. After the parent reaps the child, it increments the counter (from an
initial value of 2), prints ‘3’, and terminates.
