(a) CPU places address A on the memory bus. Main memory reads it and waits for the data word.

Disk Geometry
Disks are constructed from platters. Each platter consists of two sides, or surfaces,
that are coated with magnetic recording material. A rotating spindle in the center
of the platter spins the platter at a Ô¨Åxed rotational rate, typically between 5,400 and
15,000 revolutions per minute (RPM). A disk will typically contain one or more of
these platters encased in a sealed container.
Figure 6.9(a) shows the geometry of a typical disk surface. Each surface
consists of a collection of concentric rings called tracks. Each track is partitioned
into a collection of sectors. Each sector contains an equal number of data bits
(typically 512 bytes) encoded in the magnetic material on the sector. Sectors are
separated by gaps where no data bits are stored. Gaps store formatting bits that
identify sectors.
