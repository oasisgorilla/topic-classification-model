Representing and Manipulating Information
there is only one representation of decimal value 11 as an unsigned 4-bit number—
namely, [1011]. We highlight this as a mathematical principle, which we ﬁrst state
and then explain.
principle: Uniqueness of unsigned encoding
Function B2Uw is a bijection.
The mathematical term bijection refers to a function f that goes two ways:
it maps a value x to a value y where y = f (x), but it can also operate in reverse,
since for every y, there is a unique value x such that f (x) = y. This is given by
the inverse function f −1, where, for our example, x = f −1(y). The function B2Uw
maps each bit vector of length w to a unique number between 0 and 2w −1, and
it has an inverse, which we call U2Bw (for “unsigned to binary”), that maps each
number in the range 0 to 2w −1 to a unique pattern of w bits.
2.2.3
Two’s-Complement Encodings
For many applications, we wish to represent negative values as well. The most com-
mon computer representation of signed numbers is known as two’s-complement
form. This is deﬁned by interpreting the most signiﬁcant bit of the word to have
negative weight. We express this interpretation as a function B2Tw (for “binary
to two’s complement” length w):
principle: Deﬁnition of two’s-complement encoding
For vector ⃗
x = [xw−1, xw−2, . . . , x0]:
B2Tw(⃗
x) .

The most signiﬁcant bit xw−1 is also called the sign bit. Its “weight” is −2w−1,
the negation of its weight in an unsigned representation. When the sign bit is set
to 1, the represented value is negative, and when set to 0, the value is nonnegative.
As examples, Figure 2.13 shows the mapping, given by B2T, from bit vectors to
integers for the following cases:
B2T4([0001])
=
−0 . 23 + 0 . 22 + 0 . 21 + 1 . 20
=
0 + 0 + 0 + 1
=
1
B2T4([0101])
=
−0 . 23 + 1 . 22 + 0 . 21 + 1 . 20
=
0 + 4 + 0 + 1
=
5
B2T4([1011])
=
−1 . 23 + 0 . 22 + 1 . 21 + 1 . 20
=
−8 + 0 + 2 + 1
=
−5
B2T4([1111])
=
−1 . 23 + 1 . 22 + 1 . 21 + 1 . 20
=
−8 + 4 + 2 + 1
=
−1
(2.4)
In the ﬁgure, we indicate that the sign bit has negative weight by showing it as
a leftward-pointing gray bar. The numeric value associated with a bit vector is
then given by the combination of the possible leftward-pointing gray bar and the
rightward-pointing blue bars.
