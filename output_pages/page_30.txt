Figure 2
Five systems courses based on the CS:APP book. ICS+ is the 15-213 course
from Carnegie Mellon. Notes: The ⊙symbol denotes partial coverage of a chapter, as
follows: (a) hardware only; (b) no dynamic storage allocation; (c) no dynamic linking;
(d) no ﬂoating point.
SP
. A systems programming course. This course is similar to ICS+, but it drops
ﬂoating point and performance optimization, and it places more empha-
sis on systems programming, including process control, dynamic linking,
system-level I/O, network programming, and concurrent programming. In-
structors might want to supplement from other sources for advanced topics
such as daemons, terminal control, and Unix IPC.
The main message of Figure 2 is that the CS:APP book gives a lot of options
to students and instructors. If you want your students to be exposed to lower-
level processor architecture, then that option is available via the ORG and ORG+
courses. On the other hand, if you want to switch from your current computer
organization course to an ICS or ICS+ course, but are wary of making such a
drastic change all at once, then you can move toward ICS incrementally. You
can start with ORG, which teaches the traditional topics in a nontraditional way.
Once you are comfortable with that material, then you can move to ORG+,
and eventually to ICS. If students have no experience in C (e.g., they have only
programmed in Java), you could spend several weeks on C and then cover the
material of ORG or ICS.
Finally, we note that the ORG+ and SP courses would make a nice two-term
sequence (either quarters or semesters). Or you might consider offering ICS+ as
one term of ICS and one term of SP.
