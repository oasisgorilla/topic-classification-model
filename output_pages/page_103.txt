Figure 2.14 shows the bit patterns and numeric values for several important
numbers for different word sizes. The ﬁrst three give the ranges of representable
integers in terms of the values of UMaxw, TMinw, and TMaxw. We will refer
to these three special values often in the ensuing discussion. We will drop the
subscript w and refer to the values UMax, TMin, and TMax when w can be inferred
from context or is not central to the discussion.
A few points are worth highlighting about these numbers. First, as observed
in Figures 2.9 and 2.10, the two’s-complement range is asymmetric: |TMin| =
|TMax| + 1; that is, there is no positive counterpart to TMin. As we shall see, this
leads to some peculiar properties of two’s-complement arithmetic and can be the
source of subtle program bugs. This asymmetry arises because half the bit patterns
(those with the sign bit set to 1) represent negative numbers, while half (those
with the sign bit set to 0) represent nonnegative numbers. Since 0 is nonnegative,
this means that it can represent one less positive number than negative. Second,
the maximum unsigned value is just over twice the maximum two’s-complement
value: UMax = 2TMax + 1. All of the bit patterns that denote negative numbers in
two’s-complement notation become positive values in an unsigned representation.
