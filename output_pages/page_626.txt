where the contents of register %rax are written to address A, the CPU initiates
a write transaction. Again, there are three basic steps. First, the CPU places the
address on the system bus. The memory reads the address from the memory bus
and waits for the data to arrive (Figure 6.8(a)). Next, the CPU copies the data in
%rax to the system bus (Figure 6.8(b)). Finally, the main memory reads the data
from the memory bus and stores the bits in the DRAM (Figure 6.8(c)).
6.1.2
Disk Storage
Disks are workhorse storage devices that hold enormous amounts of data, on
the order of hundreds to thousands of gigabytes, as opposed to the hundreds or
thousands of megabytes in a RAM-based memory. However, it takes on the order
of milliseconds to read information from a disk, a hundred thousand times longer
than from DRAM and a million times longer than from SRAM.
