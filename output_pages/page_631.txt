The Memory Hierarchy
Rotational latency. Once the head is in position over the track, the drive waits
for the ﬁrst bit of the target sector to pass under the head. The perfor-
mance of this step depends on both the position of the surface when the
head arrives at the target track and the rotational speed of the disk. In the
worst case, the head just misses the target sector and waits for the disk to
make a full rotation. Thus, the maximum rotational latency, in seconds, is
given by
Tmax rotation =
1
RPM × 60 secs
1 min
The average rotational latency, Tavg rotation, is simply half of Tmax rotation.
Transfer time. When the ﬁrst bit of the target sector is under the head, the drive
can begin to read or write the contents of the sector. The transfer time
for one sector depends on the rotational speed and the number of sectors
per track. Thus, we can roughly estimate the average transfer time for one
sector in seconds as
Tavg transfer =
1
RPM ×
1
(average # sectors/track) × 60 secs
1 min
We can estimate the average time to access the contents of a disk sector as
the sum of the average seek time, the average rotational latency, and the average
transfer time. For example, consider a disk with the following parameters:
Parameter
Value
Rotational rate
7,200 RPM
Tavg seek
9 ms
Average number of sectors/track
400
For this disk, the average rotational latency (in ms) is
Tavg rotation = 1/2 × Tmax rotation
= 1/2 × (60 secs/7,200 RPM) × 1,000 ms/sec
≈4 ms
The average transfer time is
Tavg transfer = 60/7,200 RPM × 1/400 sectors/track × 1,000 ms/sec
≈0.02 ms
Putting it all together, the total estimated access time is
Taccess = Tavg seek + Tavg rotation + Tavg transfer
= 9 ms + 4 ms + 0.02 ms
= 13.02 ms
