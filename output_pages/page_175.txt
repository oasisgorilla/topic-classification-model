Representing and Manipulating Information
Hex: The four hexadecimal digits describing the encoded form.
M: The value of the signiﬁcand. This should be a number of the form x or x
y ,
where x is an integer and y is an integral power of 2. Examples include 0,
67
64, and
1
256.
E: The integer value of the exponent.
V : The numeric value represented. Use the notation x or x × 2z, where x and
z are integers.
D: The (possibly approximate) numerical value, as is printed using the %f
formatting speciﬁcation of printf.
As an example, to represent the number 7
8, we would have s = 0, M = 7
4,
and E = −1. Our number would therefore have an exponent ﬁeld of 011102
(decimal value 15 −1 = 14) and a signiﬁcand ﬁeld of 11000000002, giving a hex
representation 3B00. The numerical value is 0.875.

Consider the following two 9-bit ﬂoating-point representations based on the IEEE
ﬂoating-point format.
1. Format A
There is 1 sign bit.
There are k = 5 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 15.
There are n = 3 fraction bits.
2. Format B
There is 1 sign bit.
There are k = 4 exponent bits. The exponent bias is 7.
There are n = 4 fraction bits.
In the following table, you are given some bit patterns in format A, and your
task is to convert them to the closest value in format B. If rounding is necessary
you should round toward +∞. In addition, give the values of numbers given by
the format A and format B bit patterns. Give these as whole numbers (e.g., 17) or
as fractions (e.g., 17/64 or 17/26).
