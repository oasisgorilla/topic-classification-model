Relation between integer
and two’s-complement
addition. When x + y is
less than −2w−1, there is a
negative overﬂow. When
it is greater than or equal
to 2w−1, there is a positive
overﬂow.

(2.14)
By Equation 2.6, we can write T2Uw(x) as xw−12w + x and T2Uw(y) as
yw−12w + y. Using the property that +u
w is simply addition modulo 2w, along with
the properties of modular addition, we then have
x +t
w y = U2Tw(T2Uw(x) +u
w T2Uw(y))
= U2Tw[(xw−12w + x + yw−12w + y) mod 2w]
= U2Tw[(x + y) mod 2w]
The terms xw−12w and yw−12w drop out since they equal 0 modulo 2w.
To better understand this quantity, let us deﬁne z as the integer sum z .
= x + y,
z′ as z′ .
= z mod 2w, and z′′ as z′′ .
= U2Tw(z′). The value z′′ is equal to x +t
w y. We
can divide the analysis into four cases as illustrated in Figure 2.24:
1. −2w ≤z < −2w−1. Then we will have z′ = z + 2w. This gives 0 ≤z′ < −2w−1 +
2w = 2w−1. Examining Equation 2.7, we see that z′ is in the range such that
z′′ = z′. This is the case of negative overﬂow. We have added two negative
numbers x and y (that’s the only way we can have z < −2w−1) and obtained
a nonnegative result z′′ = x + y + 2w.
2. −2w−1 ≤z < 0. Then we will again have z′ = z + 2w, giving −2w−1 + 2w =
2w−1 ≤z′ < 2w. Examining Equation 2.7, we see that z′ is in such a range that
z′′ = z′ −2w, and therefore z′′ = z′ −2w = z + 2w −2w = z. That is, our two’s-
complement sum z′′ equals the integer sum x + y.
3. 0 ≤z < 2w−1. Then we will have z′ = z, giving 0 ≤z′ < 2w−1, and hence z′′ =
z′ = z. Again, the two’s-complement sum z′′ equals the integer sum x + y.
4. 2w−1 ≤z < 2w. We will again have z′ = z, giving 2w−1 ≤z′ < 2w. But in this
range we have z′′ = z′ −2w, giving z′′ = x + y −2w. This is the case of positive
overﬂow. We have added two positive numbers x and y (that’s the only way
we can have z ≥2w−1) and obtained a negative result z′′ = x + y −2w.
