The relationship we have seen, via several examples, between the two’s-
complement and unsigned values for a given bit pattern can be expressed as a
property of the function T2U:
principle: Conversion from two’s complement to unsigned
For x such that TMinw ≤x ≤TMaxw:
T2Uw(x) =
 x + 2w,
x < 0
x,
x ≥0
(2.5)
For example, we saw that T2U16(−12,345) = −12,345 + 216 = 53,191, and also
that T2Uw(−1) = −1 + 2w = UMaxw.
This property can be derived by comparing Equations 2.1 and 2.3.
derivation: Conversion from two’s complement to unsigned
Comparing Equations 2.1 and 2.3, we can see that for bit pattern ⃗
x, if we compute
the difference B2Uw(⃗
x) −B2Tw(⃗
x), the weighted sums for bits from 0 to w −2 will
cancel each other, leaving a value B2Uw(⃗
x) −B2Tw(⃗
x) = xw−1(2w−1 −−2w−1) =
xw−12w. This gives a relationship B2Uw(⃗
x) = B2Tw(⃗
x) + xw−12w. We therefore
have
B2Uw(T2Bw(x)) = T2Uw(x) = x + xw−12w
(2.6)
In a two’s-complement representation of x, bit xw−1 determines whether or not x
is negative, giving the two cases of Equation 2.5.
As examples, Figure 2.16 compares how functions B2U and B2T assign values
to bit patterns for w = 4. For the two’s-complement case, the most signiﬁcant bit
serves as the sign bit, which we diagram as a leftward-pointing gray bar. For the
unsigned case, this bit has positive weight, which we show as a rightward-pointing
black bar. In going from two’s complement to unsigned, the most signiﬁcant bit
changes its weight from −8 to +8. As a consequence, the values that are nega-
tive in a two’s-complement representation increase by 24 = 16 with an unsigned
representation. Thus, −5 becomes +11, and −1 becomes +15.
