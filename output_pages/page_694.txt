struct point_color square[16][16];

int i, j;
Assume the following:
. sizeof(int) = 4.
. square begins at memory address 0.
. The cache is initially empty.
. The only memory accesses are to the entries of the array square. Variables i
and j are stored in registers.
Determine the cache performance of the following code:
1
for (i = 15; i >= 0; i--){
2
for (j = 15; j >= 0; j--) {
3
square[i][j].c = 0;
4
square[i][j].m = 0;
5
square[i][j].y = 1;
6
square[i][j].k = 0;

}

}
A. What is the total number of writes?
B. What is the total number of writes that hit in the cache?
C. What is the hit rate?

Given the assumptions in Problem 6.38, determine the cache performance of the
following code:
1
for (i = 15; i >= 0; i--){
2
for (j = 15; j >= 0; j--) {
3
square[j][i].c = 0;
4
square[j][i].m = 0;
5
square[j][i].y = 1;
6
square[j][i].k = 0;
