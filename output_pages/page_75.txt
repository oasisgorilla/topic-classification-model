Converting between decimal and hexadecimal representations requires using
multiplication or division to handle the general case. To convert a decimal num-
ber x to hexadecimal, we can repeatedly divide x by 16, giving a quotient q and a
remainder r, such that x = q . 16 + r. We then use the hexadecimal digit represent-
ing r as the least signiÔ¨Åcant digit and generate the remaining digits by repeating
the process on q. As an example, consider the conversion of decimal 314,156:
314,156 = 19,634 . 16 + 12
(C)
19,634 = 1,227 . 16 + 2
(2)
1,227 = 76 . 16 + 11
(B)
76 = 4 . 16 + 12
(C)
4 = 0 . 16 + 4
(4)
From this we can read off the hexadecimal representation as 0x4CB2C.
Conversely, to convert a hexadecimal number to decimal, we can multiply
each of the hexadecimal digits by the appropriate power of 16. For example, given
the number 0x7AF, we compute its decimal equivalent as 7 . 162 + 10 . 16 + 15 =
7 . 256 + 10 . 16 + 15 = 1,792 + 160 + 15 = 1,967.
