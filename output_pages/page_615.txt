Optimizing Program Performance
We introduce a local variable last_val. At the start of iteration i, it holds the
value of p[i-1]. We then compute val to be the value of p[i] and to be the new
value for last_val.
This version compiles to the following assembly code:
Inner loop of psum1a
a in %rdi, i in %rax, cnt in %rdx, last_val in %xmm0
1
.L16:
loop:
2
vaddss
(%rdi,%rax,4), %xmm0, %xmm0
last_val = val = last_val + a[i]
3
vmovss
%xmm0, (%rsi,%rax,4)
Store val in p[i]
4
addq
$1, %rax
Increment i
5
cmpq
%rdx, %rax
Compare i:cnt
6
jne
.L16
If !=, goto loop
This code holds last_val in %xmm0, avoiding the need to read p[i-1] from
memory and thus eliminating the write/read dependency seen in psum1.
