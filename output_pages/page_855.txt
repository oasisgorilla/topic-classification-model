Figure 9.16(a) shows the steps involved when there is a TLB hit (the usual
case). The key point here is that all of the address translation steps are performed
inside the on-chip MMU and thus are fast.
Step 1. The CPU generates a virtual address.
Steps 2 and 3. The MMU fetches the appropriate PTE from the TLB.
