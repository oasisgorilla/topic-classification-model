The Memory Hierarchy
Solution to Problem 6.5 (page 637)
This is a simple problem that will give you some interesting insights into the feasi-
bility of SSDs. Recall that for disks, 1 PB = 109 MB. Then the following straight-
forward translation of units yields the following predicted times for each case:
A. Worst-case sequential writes (520 MB/s):
(109 × 128) × (1/520) × (1/(86,400 × 365)) ≈7 years
B. Worst-case random writes (205 MB/s):
(109 × 128) × (1/205) × (1/(86,400 × 365)) ≈19 years
C. Average case (50 GB/day):
(109 × 128) × (1/50,000) × (1/365) ≈6,912 years
So even if the SSD operates continuously, it should last for at least 7 years, which
is longer than the expected lifetime of most computers.
Solution to Problem 6.6 (page 640)
In the 10-year period between 2005 and 2015, the unit price of rotating disks
dropped by a factor of 166, which means the price is dropping by roughly a factor
of 2 every 18 months or so. Assuming this trend continues, a petabyte of storage,
which costs about $30,000 in 2015, will drop below $200 after about eight of these
factor-of-2 reductions. Since these are occurring every 18 months, we might expect
a petabyte of storage to be available for $200 around the year 2027.
Solution to Problem 6.7 (page 644)
To create a stride-1 reference pattern, the loops must be permuted so that the
rightmost indices change most rapidly.
1
int productarray3d(int a[N][N][N])
2
{
3
int i, j, k, product = 1;
4
5
for (j = N-1; j >= 0; j--) {
6
for (k = N-1; k >= 0; k--) {
7
for (i = N-1; i >= 0; i--) {
8
product *= a[j][k][i];
9
}
10
}
11
}
12
return product;
13
}
This is an important idea. Make sure you understand why this particular loop
permutation results in a stride-1 access pattern.
