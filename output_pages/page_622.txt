Enhanced DRAMs
There are many kinds of DRAM memories, and new kinds appear on the market
with regularity as manufacturers attempt to keep up with rapidly increasing pro-
cessor speeds. Each is based on the conventional DRAM cell, with optimizations
that improve the speed with which the basic DRAM cells can be accessed.
Fast page mode DRAM (FPM DRAM). A conventional DRAM copies an
entire row of supercells into its internal row buffer, uses one, and then
discards the rest. FPM DRAM improves on this by allowing consecutive
accesses to the same row to be served directly from the row buffer. For
example, to read four supercells from row i of a conventional DRAM, the
memory controller must send four RAS/CAS requests, even though the
row address i is identical in each case. To read supercells from the same
row of an FPM DRAM, the memory controller sends an initial RAS/CAS
request, followed by three CAS requests. The initial RAS/CAS request
copies row i into the row buffer and returns the supercell addressed by the
