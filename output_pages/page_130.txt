Figure 2.26
Two’s-complement addition. With a 4-bit word size, addition can have a
negative overﬂow when x + y < −8 and a positive overﬂow when x + y ≥8.
derivation: Detecting overﬂow of two’s-complement addition
Let us ﬁrst do the analysis for positive overﬂow. If both x > 0 and y > 0 but s ≤0,
then clearly positive overﬂow has occurred. Conversely, positive overﬂow requires
(1) that x > 0 and y > 0 (otherwise, x + y < TMaxw) and (2) that s ≤0 (from
Equation 2.13). A similar set of arguments holds for negative overﬂow.
Practice Problem 2.29 (solution page 188)
Fill in the following table in the style of Figure 2.25. Give the integer values of
the 5-bit arguments, the values of both their integer and two’s-complement sums,
the bit-level representation of the two’s-complement sum, and the case from the
derivation of Equation 2.13.
