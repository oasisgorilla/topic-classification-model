Figure 2.25
Two’s-complement addition examples. The bit-level representation of
the 4-bit two’s-complement sum can be obtained by performing binary addition of the
operands and truncating the result to 4 bits.
As illustrations of two’s-complement addition, Figure 2.25 shows some exam-
ples when w = 4. Each example is labeled by the case to which it corresponds in
the derivation of Equation 2.13. Note that 24 = 16, and hence negative overﬂow
yields a result 16 more than the integer sum, and positive overﬂow yields a result 16
less. We include bit-level representations of the operands and the result. Observe
that the result can be obtained by performing binary addition of the operands and
truncating the result to 4 bits.
Figure 2.26 illustrates two’s-complement addition for word size w = 4. The
operands range between −8 and 7. When x + y < −8, two’s-complement addition
has a negative overﬂow, causing the sum to be incremented by 16. When −8 ≤
x + y < 8, the addition yields x + y. When x + y ≥8, the addition has a positive
overﬂow, causing the sum to be decremented by 16. Each of these three ranges
forms a sloping plane in the ﬁgure.
Equation 2.13 also lets us identify the cases where overﬂow has occurred:
principle: Detecting overﬂow in two’s-complement addition
For x and y in the range TMinw ≤x, y ≤TMaxw, let s .
= x +t
w y. Then the compu-
tation of s has had positive overﬂow if and only if x > 0 and y > 0 but s ≤0. The
computation has had negative overﬂow if and only if x < 0 and y < 0 but s ≥0.
Figure 2.25 shows several illustrations of this principle for w = 4. The ﬁrst
entry shows a case of negative overﬂow, where two negative numbers sum to a
positive one. The ﬁnal entry shows a case of positive overﬂow, where two positive
numbers sum to a negative one.
