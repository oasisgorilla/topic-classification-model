The hex values B, D, and E can be translated to decimal by computing their values
relative to the ﬁrst three.
For example, suppose you are given the number 0x173A4C. You can convert
this to binary format by expanding each hexadecimal digit, as follows:
Hexadecimal
1
7
3
A
4
C
Binary
0001
0111
0011
1010
0100
1100
This gives the binary representation 000101110011101001001100.
Conversely, given a binary number 1111001010110110110011, you convert it
to hexadecimal by ﬁrst splitting it into groups of 4 bits each. Note, however, that if
the total number of bits is not a multiple of 4, you should make the leftmost group
be the one with fewer than 4 bits, effectively padding the number with leading
zeros. Then you translate each group of bits into the corresponding hexadecimal
digit:
Binary
11
1100
1010
1101
1011
0011
Hexadecimal

Practice Problem 2.1 (solution page 179)
Perform the following number conversions:
A. 0x25B9D2 to binary
B. binary 1010111001001001 to hexadecimal
C. 0xA8B3D to binary
D. binary 1100100010110110010110 to hexadecimal
When a value x is a power of 2, that is, x = 2n for some nonnegative integer
n, we can readily write x in hexadecimal form by remembering that the binary
representation of x is simply 1 followed by n zeros. The hexadecimal digit 0
represents 4 binary zeros. So, for n written in the form i + 4j, where 0 ≤i ≤3,
we can write x with a leading hex digit of 1 (i = 0), 2 (i = 1), 4 (i = 2), or 8
(i = 3), followed by j hexadecimal 0s. As an example, for x = 2,048 = 211, we
have n = 11 = 3 + 4 . 2, giving hexadecimal representation 0x800.
