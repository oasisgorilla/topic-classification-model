signiﬁcand value M = 1 and an exponent value E = −2k−1 + 2. The numeric
value is therefore V = 2−2k−1+2.
. The value 1.0 has a bit representation with all but the most signiﬁcant bit of
the exponent ﬁeld equal to 1 and all other bits equal to 0. Its signiﬁcand value
is M = 1 and its exponent value is E = 0.
. The largest normalized value has a bit representation with a sign bit of 0, the
least signiﬁcant bit of the exponent equal to 0, and all other bits equal to 1. It
has a fraction value of f = 1 −2−n, giving a signiﬁcand M = 2 −2−n (which we
have written 2 −ϵ.) It has an exponent value E = 2k−1 −1, giving a numeric
value V = (2 −2−n) × 22k−1−1 = (1 −2−n−1) × 22k−1.
One useful exercise for understanding ﬂoating-point representations is to con-
vert sample integer values into ﬂoating-point form. For example, we saw in Figure
2.15 that 12,345 has binary representation [11000000111001]. We create a normal-
ized representation of this by shifting 13 positions to the right of a binary point,
giving 12,345 = 1.10000001110012 × 213. To encode this in IEEE single-precision
format, we construct the fraction ﬁeld by dropping the leading 1 and adding 10
zeros to the end, giving binary representation [10000001110010000000000]. To
construct the exponent ﬁeld, we add bias 127 to 13, giving 140, which has bi-
nary representation [10001100]. We combine this with a sign bit of 0 to get the
ﬂoating-point representation in binary of [01000110010000001110010000000000].
Recall from Section 2.1.3 that we observed the following correlation in the bit-
level representations of the integer value 12345 (0x3039) and the single-precision
ﬂoating-point value 12345.0 (0x4640E400):

We can now see that the region of correlation corresponds to the low-order
bits of the integer, stopping just before the most signiﬁcant bit equal to 1 (this bit
forms the implied leading 1), matching the high-order bits in the fraction part of
the ﬂoating-point representation.
Practice Problem 2.48 (solution page 195)
As mentioned in Problem 2.6, the integer 3,510,593 has hexadecimal represen-
tation 0x00359141, while the single-precision ﬂoating-point number 3,510,593.0
has hexadecimal representation 0x4A564504. Derive this ﬂoating-point represen-
tation and explain the correlation between the bits of the integer and ﬂoating-point
representations.
