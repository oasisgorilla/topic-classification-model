2.2.1
Integral Data Types
C supports a variety of integral data types—ones that represent ﬁnite ranges of
integers. These are shown in Figures 2.9 and 2.10, along with the ranges of values
they can have for “typical” 32- and 64-bit programs. Each type can specify a
size with keyword char, short, long, as well as an indication of whether the
represented numbers are all nonnegative (declared as unsigned), or possibly
negative (the default.) As we saw in Figure 2.3, the number of bytes allocated for
the different sizes varies according to whether the program is compiled for 32 or
64 bits. Based on the byte allocations, the different sizes allow different ranges of
values to be represented. The only machine-dependent range indicated is for size
designator long. Most 64-bit programs use an 8-byte representation, giving a much
wider range of values than the 4-byte representation used with 32-bit programs.
One important feature to note in Figures 2.9 and 2.10 is that the ranges are not
symmetric—the range of negative numbers extends one further than the range of
positive numbers. We will see why this happens when we consider how negative
numbers are represented.
