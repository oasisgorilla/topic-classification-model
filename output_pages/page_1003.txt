D. Consult the HTTP/1.1 standard in RFC 2616 to determine the meaning of
each header in the HTTP request from your browser. You can obtain RFC
2616 from www.rfc-editor.org/rfc.html.
11.7 ◆◆
Extend Tiny so that it serves MPG video ﬁles. Check your work using a real
browser.
11.8 ◆◆
Modify Tiny so that it reaps CGI children inside a SIGCHLD handler instead of
explicitly waiting for them to terminate.
11.9 ◆◆
Modify Tiny so that when it serves static content, it copies the requested ﬁle to the
connected descriptor using malloc, rio_readn, and rio_writen, instead of mmap
and rio_writen.
11.10 ◆◆
A. Write an HTML form for the CGI adder function in Figure 11.27. Your form
should include two text boxes that users ﬁll in with the two numbers to be
added together. Your form should request content using the GET method.
B. Check your work by using a real browser to request the form from Tiny,
submit the ﬁlled-in form to Tiny, and then display the dynamic content
generated by adder.
11.11 ◆◆
Extend Tiny to support the HTTP HEAD method. Check your work using telnet
as a Web client.
11.12 ◆◆◆
Extend Tiny so that it serves dynamic content requested by the HTTP POST
method. Check your work using your favorite Web browser.
11.13 ◆◆◆
Modify Tiny so that it deals cleanly (without terminating) with the SIGPIPE
signals and EPIPE errors that occur when the write function attempts to write to
a prematurely closed connection.
