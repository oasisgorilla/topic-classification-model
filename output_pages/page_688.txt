Suppose we have a system with the following properties:
. The memory is byte addressable.
. Memory accesses are to 1-byte words (not to 4-byte words).
. Addresses are 12 bits wide.
. The cache is two-way set associative (E = 2), with a 4-byte block size (B = 4)
and four sets (S = 4).
The contents of the cache are as follows, with all addresses, tags, and values given
in hexadecimal notation:
Set index

Byte 1
Byte 2
