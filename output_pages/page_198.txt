F.
1.0/2 == 1/2.0
Yes, the numerators and denominators will both be converted to ﬂoating-
point representations before the division is performed.
G. d*d >= 0.0
Yes, although it may overﬂow to +∞.
H. (f+d)-f == d
No. For example, when f is 1.0e20 and d is 1.0, the expression f+d will be
rounded to 1.0e20, and so the expression on the left-hand side will evaluate
to 0.0, while the right-hand side will be 1.0.
