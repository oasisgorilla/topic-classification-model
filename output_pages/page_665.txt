The Memory Hierarchy
as the translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) in virtual memory systems that cache
page table entries (Section 9.6.2).
Practice Problem 6.12 (solution page 699)
The problems that follow will help reinforce your understanding of how caches
work. Assume the following:
. The memory is byte addressable.
. Memory accesses are to 1-byte words (not to 4-byte words).
. Addresses are 13 bits wide.
. The cache is two-way set associative (E = 2), with a 4-byte block size (B = 4)
and eight sets (S = 8).
The contents of the cache are as follows, with all numbers given in hexadecimal
notation.
