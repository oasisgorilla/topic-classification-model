PIPE PC selection and fetch logic. Within the one cycle time limit, the
processor can only predict the address of the next instruction.
memory and for extracting the different instruction ﬁelds are the same as those
we considered for SEQ (see the fetch stage in Section 4.3.4).
The PC selection logic chooses between three program counter sources. As a
mispredicted branch enters the memory stage, the value of valP for this instruction
(indicating the address of the following instruction) is read from pipeline register
M (signal M_valA). When a ret instruction enters the write-back stage, the return
address is read from pipeline register W (signal W_valM). All other cases use the
predicted value of the PC, stored in pipeline register F (signal F_predPC):
word f_pc = [
# Mispredicted branch.
Fetch at incremented PC
M_icode == IJXX && !M_Cnd : M_valA;
# Completion of RET instruction
W_icode == IRET : W_valM;
# Default: Use predicted value of PC
