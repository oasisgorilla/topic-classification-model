world!\n.

Determine the block sizes and header values that would result from the fol-
lowing sequence of malloc requests. Assumptions: (1) The allocator maintains
double-word alignment and uses an implicit free list with the block format from
Figure 9.35. (2) Block sizes are rounded up to the nearest multiple of 8 bytes.

Block size (decimal bytes)
Block header (hex)

Determine the minimum block size for each of the following combinations of
alignment requirements and block formats. Assumptions: Explicit free list, 4-byte
pred and succ pointers in each free block, zero-size payloads are not allowed, and
headers and footers are stored in 4-byte words.

Develop a version of the allocator in Section 9.9.12 that performs a next-ﬁt search
instead of a ﬁrst-ﬁt search.
9.18 ◆◆◆
The allocator in Section 9.9.12 requires both a header and a footer for each block
in order to perform constant-time coalescing. Modify the allocator so that free
blocks require a header and a footer, but allocated blocks require only a header.
