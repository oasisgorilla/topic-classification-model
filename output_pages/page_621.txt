Reading the contents of a DRAM supercell.
Memory Modules
DRAM chips are packaged in memory modules that plug into expansion slots on
the main system board (motherboard). Core i7 systems use the 240-pin dual inline
memory module (DIMM),which transfers data to and from the memory controller
in 64-bit chunks.
Figure 6.5 shows the basic idea of a memory module. The example module
stores a total of 64 MB (megabytes) using eight 64-Mbit 8M × 8 DRAM chips,
numbered 0 to 7. Each supercell stores 1 byte of main memory, and each 64-bit
word at byte address A in main memory is represented by the eight supercells
whose corresponding supercell address is (i, j). In the example in Figure 6.5,
DRAM 0 stores the ﬁrst (lower-order) byte, DRAM 1 stores the next byte, and
so on.
To retrieve the word at memory address A, the memory controller converts
A to a supercell address (i, j) and sends it to the memory module, which then
broadcasts i and j to each DRAM. In response, each DRAM outputs the 8-bit
contents of its (i, j) supercell. Circuitry in the module collects these outputs and
forms them into a 64-bit word, which it returns to the memory controller.
Main memory can be aggregated by connecting multiple memory modules to
the memory controller. In this case, when the controller receives an address A, the
controller selects the module k that contains A, converts A to its (i, j) form, and
sends (i, j) to module k.
Practice Problem 6.1 (solution page 696)
In the following, let r be the number of rows in a DRAM array, c the number of
columns, br the number of bits needed to address the rows, and bc the number of
bits needed to address the columns. For each of the following DRAMs, determine
the power-of-2 array dimensions that minimize max(br, bc), the maximum number
of bits needed to address the rows or columns of the array.
