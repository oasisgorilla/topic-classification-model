hierarchy. Storage devices that are higher in the hierarchy serve as caches for de-
vices that are lower in the hierarchy. Programmers can optimize the performance
of their C programs by understanding and exploiting the memory hierarchy.
The operating system kernel serves as an intermediary between the applica-
tion and the hardware. It provides three fundamental abstractions: (1) Files are
abstractions for I/O devices. (2) Virtual memory is an abstraction for both main
memory and disks. (3) Processes are abstractions for the processor, main memory,
and I/O devices.
Finally, networks provide ways for computer systems to communicate with
one another. From the viewpoint of a particular system, the network is just another
I/O device.
Bibliographic Notes
Ritchie has written interesting ﬁrsthand accounts of the early days of C and
Unix [91, 92]. Ritchie and Thompson presented the ﬁrst published account of
Unix [93]. Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne [102] provide a comprehensive history
of the different ﬂavors of Unix. The GNU (www.gnu.org) and Linux (www.linux
.org) Web pages have loads of current and historical information. The Posix
standards are available online at (www.unix.org).
Solutions to Practice Problems
Solution to Problem 1.1 (page 58)
This problem illustrates that Amdahl’s law applies to more than just computer
systems.
A. In terms of Equation 1.1, we have α = 0.6 and k = 1.5. More directly, travel-
ing the 1,500 kilometers through Montana will require 10 hours, and the rest
of the trip also requires 10 hours. This will give a speedup of 25/(10 + 10) =
1.25×.
B. In terms of Equation 1.1, we have α = 0.6, and we require S = 1.67, from
which we can solve for k. More directly, to speed up the trip by 1.67×, we
must decrease the overall time to 15 hours. The parts outside of Montana
will still require 10 hours, so we must drive through Montana in 5 hours.
This requires traveling at 300 km/hr, which is pretty fast for a truck!
Solution to Problem 1.2 (page 59)
Amdahl’s law is best understood by working through some examples. This one
requires you to look at Equation 1.1 from an unusual perspective. This problem
is a simple application of the equation. You are given S = 4 and α = 0.9, and you
must then solve for k:
4 = 1/(1 −0.9) + 0.9/k
0.4 + 3.6/k = 1.0
k = 6.0
