Summary of Memory Hierarchy Concepts
To summarize, memory hierarchies based on caching work because slower storage
is cheaper than faster storage and because programs tend to exhibit locality:
Exploiting temporal locality. Because of temporal locality, the same data objects
are likely to be reused multiple times. Once a data object has been copied
into the cache on the ﬁrst miss, we can expect a number of subsequent
hits on that object. Since the cache is faster than the storage at the next
lower level, these subsequent hits can be served much faster than the
original miss.
Exploiting spatial locality. Blocks usually contain multiple data objects. Because
of spatial locality, we can expect that the cost of copying a block after a
miss will be amortized by subsequent references to other objects within
that block.
Caches are used everywhere in modern systems. As you can see from Fig-
ure 6.23, caches are used in CPU chips, operating systems, distributed ﬁle systems,
and on the World Wide Web. They are built from and managed by various com-
binations of hardware and software. Note that there are a number of terms and
acronyms in Figure 6.23 that we haven’t covered yet. We include them here to
demonstrate how common caches are.

Cache Memories
The memory hierarchies of early computer systems consisted of only three levels:
CPU registers, main memory, and disk storage. However, because of the increasing
gap between CPU and main memory, system designers were compelled to insert
