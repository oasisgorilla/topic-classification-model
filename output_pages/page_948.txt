Standard I/O
The C language deﬁnes a set of higher-level input and output functions, called the
standard I/O library, that provides programmers with a higher-level alternative
to Unix I/O. The library (libc) provides functions for opening and closing ﬁles
(fopen and fclose), reading and writing bytes (fread and fwrite), reading and
writing strings (fgets and fputs), and sophisticated formatted I/O (scanf and
printf).
The standard I/O library models an open ﬁle as a stream. To the programmer, a
stream is a pointer to a structure of type FILE. Every ANSI C program begins with
three open streams, stdin, stdout, and stderr, which correspond to standard
input, standard output, and standard error, respectively:
#include <stdio.h>
extern FILE *stdin;
/* Standard input (descriptor 0) */
extern FILE *stdout;
/* Standard output (descriptor 1) */
extern FILE *stderr;
/* Standard error (descriptor 2) */
A stream of type FILE is an abstraction for a ﬁle descriptor and a stream
buffer. The purpose of the stream buffer is the same as the Rio read buffer: to
minimize the number of expensive Linux I/O system calls. For example, suppose
we have a program that makes repeated calls to the standard I/O getc function,
where each invocation returns the next character from a ﬁle. When getc is called
the ﬁrsttime, thelibraryﬁllsthestreambufferwithasinglecalltothe read function
and then returns the ﬁrst byte in the buffer to the application. As long as there are
unread bytes in the buffer, subsequent calls to getc can be served directly from
the stream buffer.
