as its unsigned argument.

Around 250 B.C., the Greek mathematician Archimedes proved that 223
71 < π < 22
7 .
Hadhehadaccesstoa computerandthestandardlibrary <math.h>, hewouldhave
been able to determine that the single-precision ﬂoating-point approximation of
π has the hexadecimal representation 0x40490FDB. Of course, all of these are just
approximations, since π is not rational.
A. What is the fractional binary number denoted by this ﬂoating-point value?
B. What is the fractional binary representation of 22
7 ? Hint: See Problem 2.83.
C. At what bit position (relative to the binary point) do these two approxima-
tions to π diverge?
