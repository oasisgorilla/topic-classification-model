Arithmetic/logic unit (ALU). Depending on the setting of the function
input, the circuit will perform one of four different arithmetic and logical operations.
Practice Problem 4.12 (solution page 520)
Write HCL code describing a circuit that for word inputs A, B, and C selects the
median of the three values. That is, the output equals the word lying between the
minimum and maximum of the three inputs.
Combinational logic circuits can be designed to perform many different types
of operations on word-level data. The detailed design of these is beyond the
scope of our presentation. One important combinational circuit, known as an
arithmetic/logic unit (ALU), is diagrammed at an abstract level in Figure 4.15.
In our version, the circuit has three inputs: two data inputs labeled A and B and
a control input. Depending on the setting of the control input, the circuit will
perform different arithmetic or logical operations on the data inputs. Observe
that the four operations diagrammed for this ALU correspond to the four different
integer operations supported by the Y86-64 instruction set, and the control values
match the function codes for these instructions (Figure 4.3). Note also the ordering
of operands for subtraction, where the A input is subtracted from the B input.
This ordering is chosen in anticipation of the ordering of arguments in the subq
instruction.

Set Membership
In our processor designs, we will Ô¨Ånd many examples where we want to compare
one signal against a number of possible matching signals, such as to test whether
the code for some instruction being processed matches some category of instruc-
tion codes. As a simple example, suppose we want to generate the signals s1 and
s0 for the 4-way multiplexor of Figure 4.14 by selecting the high- and low-order
bits from a 2-bit signal code, as follows:
