About the Authors
David R. O’Hallaron is a professor of computer science
and electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie
Mellon University. He received his PhD from the Uni-
versity of Virginia. He served as the director of Intel
Labs, Pittsburgh, from 2007 to 2010.
He has taught computer systems courses at the un-
dergraduate and graduate levels for 20 years on such
topics as computer architecture, introductory com-
puter systems, parallel processor design, and Internet
services. Together with Professor Bryant, he developed
the course at Carnegie Mellon that led to this book. In
2004, he was awarded the Herbert Simon Award for Teaching Excellence by the
CMU School of Computer Science, an award for which the winner is chosen based
on a poll of the students.
Professor O’Hallaron works in the area of computer systems, with speciﬁc in-
terests in software systems for scientiﬁc computing, data-intensive computing, and
virtualization. The best-known example of his work is the Quake project, an en-
deavor involving a group of computer scientists, civil engineers, and seismologists
who have developed the ability to predict the motion of the ground during strong
earthquakes. In 2003, Professor O’Hallaron and the other members of the Quake
team won the Gordon Bell Prize, the top international prize in high-performance
computing. His current work focuses on the notion of autograding, that is, pro-
grams that evaluate the quality of other programs.
