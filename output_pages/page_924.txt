Part III
Interaction and
Communication
between Programs
T
o this point in our study of computer systems, we have assumed that pro-
grams run in isolation, with minimal input and output. However, in the real
world, application programs use services provided by the operating system
to communicate with I/O devices and with other programs.
This part of the book will give you an understanding of the basic I/O services
provided by Unix operating systems and how to use these services to build appli-
cations such as Web clients and servers that communicate with each other over
the Internet. You will learn techniques for writing concurrent programs, such as
Web servers that can service multiple clients at the same time. Writing concurrent
application programs can also allow them to execute faster on modern multi-core
processors. When you Ô¨Ånish this part, you will be well on your way to becoming a
power programmer with a mature understanding of computer systems and their
impact on your programs.
