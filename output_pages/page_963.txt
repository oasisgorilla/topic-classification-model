Network Programming
#include <arpa/inet.h>
uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong);
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort);
Returns: value in network byte order
uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t netlong);
uint16_t ntohs(unit16_t netshort);
Returns: value in host byte order
The htonl function converts an unsigned 32-bit integer from host byte order to
network byte order. The ntohl function converts an unsigned 32-bit integer from
network byte order to host byte order. The htons and ntohs functions perform
corresponding conversions for unsigned 16-bit integers. Note that there are no
equivalent functions for manipulating 64-bit values.
IP addresses are typically presented to humans in a form known as dotted-
decimal notation, where each byte is represented by its decimal value and sep-
arated from the other bytes by a period. For example, 128.2.194.242 is the
dotted-decimal representation of the address 0x8002c2f2. On Linux systems, you
can use the hostname command to determine the dotted-decimal address of your
own host:
linux> hostname -i
128.2.210.175
Application programs can convert back and forth between IP addresses and
dotted-decimal strings using the functions inet_pton and inet_ntop.
#include <arpa/inet.h>
int inet_pton(AF_INET, const char *src, void *dst);
Returns: 1 if OK, 0 if src is invalid dotted decimal, −1 on error
const char *inet_ntop(AF_INET, const void *src, char *dst,
socklen_t size);
Returns: pointer to a dotted-decimal string if OK, NULL on error
In these function names, the “n” stands for network and the “p” stands for pre-
sentation. They can manipulate either 32-bit IPv4 addresses (AF_INET), as shown
here, or 128-bit IPv6 addresses (AF_INET6), which we do not cover.
The inet_pton function converts a dotted-decimal string (src) to a binary IP
address in network byte order (dst). If src does not point to a valid dotted-decimal
string, then it returns 0. Any other error returns −1 and sets errno. Similarly, the
inet_ntop function converts a binary IP address in network byte order (src) to
the corresponding dotted-decimal representation and copies at most size bytes
of the resulting null-terminated string to dst.
