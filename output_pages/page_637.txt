Characteristics of a commercial disk drive
Disk manufacturers publish a lot of useful high-level technical information on their Web sites. For
example, the Seagate Web site contains the following information (and much more!) about one of
their popular drives, the Barracuda 7400.

Solid State Disks
A solid state disk (SSD) is a storage technology, based on ﬂash memory (Sec-
tion 6.1.1), that in some situations is an attractive alternative to the conventional
rotating disk. Figure 6.13 shows the basic idea. An SSD package plugs into a stan-
dard disk slot on the I/O bus (typically USB or SATA) and behaves like any other
disk, processing requests from the CPU to read and write logical disk blocks. An
SSD package consists of one or more ﬂash memory chips, which replace the me-
chanical drive in a conventional rotating disk, and a ﬂash translation layer, which
is a hardware/ﬁrmware device that plays the same role as a disk controller, trans-
lating requests for logical blocks into accesses of the underlying physical device.
Figure 6.14 shows the performance characteristics of a typical SSD. Notice that
reading from SSDs is faster than writing. The difference between random reading
and writing performance is caused by a fundamental property of the underlying
ﬂash memory. As shown in Figure 6.13, a ﬂash memory consists of a sequence of B
blocks, where each block consists of P pages. Typically, pages are 512 bytes to 4 KB
in size, and a block consists of 32–128 pages, with total block sizes ranging from 16
