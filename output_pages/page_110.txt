Comparing unsigned
and two’s-complement
representations for w = 4.
The weight of the most
signiﬁcant bit is −8 for
two’s complement and +8
for unsigned, yielding a net
difference of 16.

Figure 2.17 illustrates the general behavior of function T2U. As it shows, when
mapping a signed number to its unsigned counterpart, negative numbers are con-
verted to large positive numbers, while nonnegative numbers remain unchanged.
Practice Problem 2.20 (solution page 185)
Explain how Equation 2.5 applies to the entries in the table you generated when
solving Problem 2.19.
Going in the other direction, we can state the relationship between an un-
signed number u and its signed counterpart U2Tw(u):
principle: Unsigned to two’s-complement conversion
For u such that 0 ≤u ≤UMaxw:
U2Tw(u) =
 u,
u ≤TMaxw
u −2w,
u > TMaxw
