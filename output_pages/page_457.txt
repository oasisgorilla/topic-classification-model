Limitations of pipelining due to logical dependencies. In going from an
unpipelined system with feedback (a) to a pipelined one (c), we change its computational
behavior, as can be seen by the two pipeline diagrams (b and d).
instruction is fed back around to the next instruction. This is illustrated by the
pipeline diagram (Figure 4.38(b)), where the result of I1 becomes an input to
I2, and so on. If we attempt to convert this to a three-stage pipeline in the most
straightforward manner (Figure 4.38(c)), we change the behavior of the system.
As Figure 4.38(c) shows, the result of I1 becomes an input to I4. In attempting to
speed up the system via pipelining, we have changed the system behavior.
