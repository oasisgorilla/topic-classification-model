a speciﬁc implementation—namely, the global IP Internet.

To simplify our pictures of LANs, we will draw the hubs and bridges and the
wires that connect them as a single horizontal line, as shown in Figure 11.5.
At a higher level in the hierarchy, multiple incompatible LANs can be con-
nected by specialized computers called routers to form an internet (interconnected
network). Each router has an adapter (port) for each network that it is connected
to. Routers can also connect high-speed point-to-point phone connections, which
are examples of networks known as WANs (wide area networks), so called be-
cause they span larger geographical areas than LANs. In general, routers can be
used to build internets from arbitrary collections of LANs and WANs. For ex-
ample, Figure 11.6 shows an example internet with a pair of LANs and WANs
connected by three routers.
