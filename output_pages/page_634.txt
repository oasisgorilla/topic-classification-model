. A graphics card (or adapter) contains hardware and software logic that is re-
sponsible for painting the pixels on the display monitor on behalf of the CPU.
. A host bus adapter that connects one or more disks to the I/O bus using
a communication protocol deﬁned by a particular host bus interface. The
two most popular such interfaces for disks are SCSI (pronounced “scuzzy”)
and SATA (pronounced “sat-uh”). SCSI disks are typically faster and more
expensive than SATA drives. A SCSI host bus adapter (often called a SCSI
controller) can support multiple disk drives, as opposed to SATA adapters,
which can only support one drive.
Additional devices such as network adapters can be attached to the I/O bus by
plugging the adapter into empty expansion slots on the motherboard that provide
a direct electrical connection to the bus.
Accessing Disks
While a detailed description of how I/O devices work and how they are pro-
grammed is outside our scope here, we can give you a general idea. For example,
Figure 6.12 summarizes the steps that take place when a CPU reads data from a
disk.
