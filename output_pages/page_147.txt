Fractional binary
representation. Digits
to the left of the binary
point have weights of the
form 2i, while those to the
right have weights of the
form 1/2i.

where each decimal digit di ranges between 0 and 9. This notation represents a
value d deﬁned as
d =

i=−n
10i × di
The weighting of the digits is deﬁned relative to the decimal point symbol (‘.’),
meaning that digits to the left are weighted by nonnegative powers of 10, giving
integral values, while digits to the right are weighted by negative powers of 10,
giving fractional values. For example, 12.3410 represents the number 1 × 101 +
2 × 100 + 3 × 10−1 + 4 × 10−2 = 12 34
100.
By analogy, consider a notation of the form
bm bm−1 . . . b1 b0 . b−1 b−2 . . . b−n+1 b−n
where each binary digit, or bit, bi ranges between 0 and 1, as is illustrated in
Figure 2.31. This notation represents a number b deﬁned as
b =
m

i=−n
2i × bi
(2.19)
The symbol ‘.’ now becomes a binary point, with bits on the left being weighted
by nonnegative powers of 2, and those on the right being weighted by negative
powers of 2. For example, 101.112 represents the number 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 ×
20 + 1 × 2−1 + 1 × 2−2 = 4 + 0 + 1 + 1
2 + 1
4 = 53
4.
One can readily see from Equation 2.19 that shifting the binary point one
position to the left has the effect of dividing the number by 2. For example, while
101.112 represents the number 53
4, 10.1112 represents the number 2 + 0 + 1
2 +
