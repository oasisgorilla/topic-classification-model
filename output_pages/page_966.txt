for debugging. We can use hostname to determine the real domain name of our
local host:
linux> hostname
whaleshark.ics.cs.cmu.edu
In the simplest case, there is a one-to-one mapping between a domain name
and an IP address:
linux> nslookup whaleshark.ics.cs.cmu.edu
Address: 128.2.210.175
However, in some cases, multiple domain names are mapped to the same IP
address:
linux> nslookup cs.mit.edu
Address: 18.62.1.6
linux> nslookup eecs.mit.edu
Address: 18.62.1.6
In the most general case, multiple domain names are mapped to the same set of
multiple IP addresses:
linux> nslookup www.twitter.com
Address: 199.16.156.6
Address: 199.16.156.70
Address: 199.16.156.102
Address: 199.16.156.230
linux> nslookup twitter.com
Address: 199.16.156.102
Address: 199.16.156.230
Address: 199.16.156.6
Address: 199.16.156.70
Finally, we notice that some valid domain names are not mapped to any IP
address:
linux> nslookup edu
*** Can’t find edu: No answer
linux> nslookup ics.cs.cmu.edu
*** Can’t find ics.cs.cmu.edu: No answer

Internet Connections
Internet clients and servers communicate by sending and receiving streams of
bytes over connections. A connection is point-to-point in the sense that it connects
a pair of processes. It is full duplex in the sense that data can ﬂow in both directions
