Chapter 6
The Memory Hierarchy
For each case below, suppose that a program reads the logical blocks of the
ﬁle sequentially, one after the other, and that the time to position the head over
the ﬁrst block is Tavg seek + Tavg rotation.
A. Best case: Estimate the optimal time (in ms) required to read the ﬁle given
the best possible mapping of logical blocks to disk sectors (i.e., sequential).
B. Random case: Estimate the time (in ms) required to read the ﬁle if blocks
are mapped randomly to disk sectors.

The following table gives the parameters for a number of different caches. For
each cache, ﬁll in the missing ﬁelds in the table. Recall that m is the number of
physical address bits, C is the cache size (number of data bytes), B is the block
size in bytes, E is the associativity, S is the number of cache sets, t is the number of
tag bits, s is the number of set index bits, and b is the number of block offset bits.
