Data-ï¬‚ow representation
of function write_read.
When the two addresses
do not match, the only
critical path is formed by
the decrementing of cnt
(Example A). When they
do match, the chain of
data being stored, loaded,
and incremented forms the
critical path (Example B).

Suppose a is an array of length 1,000 initialized so that each element a[i]
equals i.
A. What would be the effect of the call copy_array(a+1,a,999)?
B. What would be the effect of the call copy_array(a,a+1,999)?
C. Our performance measurements indicate that the call of part A has a CPE
of 1.2 (which drops to 1.0 when the loop is unrolled by a factor of 4), while
the call of part B has a CPE of 5.0. To what factor do you attribute this
performance difference?
D. What performance would you expect for the call copy_array(a,a,999)?
