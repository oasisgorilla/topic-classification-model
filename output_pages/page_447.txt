address and the memory input data (for write operations). Two other blocks
generate the control signals indicating whether to perform a read or a write
operation. When a read operation is performed, the data memory generates the
value valM.
The desired memory operation for each instruction type is shown in the
memory stage of Figures 4.18 to 4.21. Observe that the address for memory reads
and writes is always valE or valA. We can describe this block in HCL as follows:
word mem_addr = [
icode in { IRMMOVQ, IPUSHQ, ICALL, IMRMOVQ } : valE;
icode in { IPOPQ, IRET } : valA;
# Other instructions donâ€™t need address
];
Practice Problem 4.25 (solution page 524)
Looking at the memory operations for the different instructions shown in Fig-
ures 4.18 to 4.21, we can see that the data for memory writes are always either
valA or valP. Write HCL code for the signal mem_data in SEQ.
We want to set the control signal mem_read only for instructions that read
data from memory, as expressed by the following HCL code:
bool mem_read = icode in { IMRMOVQ, IPOPQ, IRET };
Practice Problem 4.26 (solution page 525)
We want to set the control signal mem_write only for instructions that write data
to memory. Write HCL code for the signal mem_write in SEQ.
