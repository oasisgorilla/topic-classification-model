Figure 4.35
One clock cycle of pipeline operation. Just before the clock rises at
time 240 (point 1), instructions I1 (shown in dark gray) and I2 (shown in blue) have
completed stages B and A. After the clock rises, these instructions begin propagating
through stages C and B, while instruction I3 (shown in light gray) begins propagating
through stage A (points 2 and 3). Just before the clock rises again, the results for the
instructions have propagated to the inputs of the pipeline registers (point 4).
