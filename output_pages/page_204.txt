vantage of technology improvements as well as to satisfy the demands for higher
performance and for supporting more advanced operating systems.
The list that follows shows some models of Intel processors and some of their
key features, especially those affecting machine-level programming. We use the
number of transistors required to implement the processors as an indication of
how they have evolved in complexity. In this table, “K” denotes 1,000 (103), “M”
denotes 1,000,000 (106), and “G” denotes 1,000,000,000 (109).
8086 (1978, 29 K transistors). One of the ﬁrst single-chip, 16-bit microproces-
sors. The 8088, a variant of the 8086 with an 8-bit external bus, formed
the heart of the original IBM personal computers. IBM contracted with
then-tiny Microsoft to develop the MS-DOS operating system. The orig-
inal models came with 32,768 bytes of memory and two ﬂoppy drives (no
hard drive). Architecturally, the machines were limited to a 655,360-byte
address space—addresses were only 20 bits long (1,048,576 bytes address-
able), and the operating system reserved 393,216 bytes for its own use.
In 1980, Intel introduced the 8087 ﬂoating-point coprocessor (45 K tran-
sistors) to operate alongside an 8086 or 8088 processor, executing the
ﬂoating-point instructions. The 8087 established the ﬂoating-point model
for the x86 line, often referred to as “x87.”
80286 (1982, 134 K transistors). Added more (and now obsolete) addressing
modes. Formed the basis of the IBM PC-AT personal computer, the
original platform for MS Windows.
i386 (1985, 275 K transistors). Expanded the architecture to 32 bits. Added the
ﬂat addressing model used by Linux and recent versions of the Windows
operating system. This was the ﬁrst machine in the series that could fully
support a Unix operating system.
i486 (1989, 1.2 M transistors). Improved performance and integrated the ﬂoat-
ing-point unit onto the processor chip but did not signiﬁcantly change the
instruction set.
Pentium (1993, 3.1 M transistors). Improved performance but only added mi-
nor extensions to the instruction set.
PentiumPro (1995, 5.5 M transistors). Introduced a radically new processor
design, internally known as the P6 microarchitecture. Added a class of
“conditional move” instructions to the instruction set.
Pentium/MMX (1997, 4.5 M transistors). Added new class of instructions to the
Pentium processor for manipulating vectors of integers. Each datum can
be 1, 2, or 4 bytes long. Each vector totals 64 bits.
Pentium II (1997, 7 M transistors). Continuation of the P6 microarchitecture.
Pentium III (1999, 8.2 M transistors). Introduced SSE, a class of instructions for
manipulating vectors of integer or ﬂoating-point data. Each datum can be
1, 2, or 4 bytes, packed into vectors of 128 bits. Later versions of this chip
