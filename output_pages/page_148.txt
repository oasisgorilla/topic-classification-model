8. Similarly, shifting the binary point one position to the right has the
effect of multiplying the number by 2. For example, 1011.12 represents the number
8 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1
2 = 111
2.
Note that numbers of the form 0.11 . . . 12 represent numbers just below 1. For
example, 0.1111112 represents 63
64. We will use the shorthand notation 1.0 −ϵ to
represent such values.
Assuming we consider only ﬁnite-length encodings, decimal notation cannot
represent numbers such as 1
3 and 5
7 exactly. Similarly, fractional binary notation
can only represent numbers that can be written x × 2y. Other values can only be
approximated. For example, the number 1
5 can be represented exactly as the frac-
tional decimal number 0.20. As a fractional binary number, however, we cannot
represent it exactly and instead must approximate it with increasing accuracy by
lengthening the binary representation:

Practice Problem 2.46 (solution page 194)
The imprecision of ﬂoating-point arithmetic can have disastrous effects. On Febru-
ary 25, 1991, during the ﬁrst Gulf War, an American Patriot Missile battery in
Dharan, Saudi Arabia, failed to intercept an incoming Iraqi Scud missile. The
Scud struck an American Army barracks and killed 28 soldiers. The US General
