modulo 16.
occurs when the two operands sum to 2w or more. Figure 2.23 shows a plot of the
unsigned addition function for word size w = 4. The sum is computed modulo
24 = 16. When x + y < 16, there is no overﬂow, and x +u
4 y is simply x + y. This is
shown as the region forming a sloping plane labeled “Normal.” When x + y ≥16,
the addition overﬂows, having the effect of decrementing the sum by 16. This is
shown as the region forming a sloping plane labeled “Overﬂow.”
When executing C programs, overﬂows are not signaled as errors. At times,
however, we might wish to determine whether or not overﬂow has occurred.
principle: Detecting overﬂow of unsigned addition
For x and y in the range 0 ≤x, y ≤UMaxw, let s .
= x +u
w y. Then the computation
of s overﬂowed if and only if s < x (or equivalently, s < y).
As an illustration, in our earlier example, we saw that 9 +u
4 12 = 5. We can see
that overﬂow occurred, since 5 < 9.
