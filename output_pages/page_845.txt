9.3.3
Page Hits
Consider what happens when the CPU reads a word of virtual memory contained
in VP 2, which is cached in DRAM (Figure 9.5). Using a technique we will describe
in detail in Section 9.6, the address translation hardware uses the virtual address
as an index to locate PTE 2 and read it from memory. Since the valid bit is set, the
address translation hardware knows that VP 2 is cached in memory. So it uses the
physical memory address in the PTE (which points to the start of the cached page
in PP 1) to construct the physical address of the word.
9.3.4
Page Faults
In virtual memory parlance, a DRAM cache miss is known as a page fault. Fig-
ure 9.6 shows the state of our example page table before the fault. The CPU has
referenced a word in VP 3, which is not cached in DRAM. The address transla-
tion hardware reads PTE 3 from memory, infers from the valid bit that VP 3 is
not cached, and triggers a page fault exception. The page fault exception invokes
a page fault exception handler in the kernel, which selects a victim page—in this
case, VP 4 stored in PP 3. If VP 4 has been modiﬁed, then the kernel copies it back
to disk. In either case, the kernel modiﬁes the page table entry for VP 4 to reﬂect
the fact that VP 4 is no longer cached in main memory.
