w = 4. Bit 3 serves as a
sign bit; when set to 1, it
contributes −23 = −8 to
the value. This weighting
is shown as a leftward-

We see that the bit patterns are identical for Figures 2.12 and 2.13 (as well as
for Equations 2.2 and 2.4), but the values differ when the most signiﬁcant bit is 1,
since in one case it has weight +8, and in the other case it has weight −8.
Let us consider the range of values that can be represented as a w-bit two’s-
complement number. The least representable value is given by bit vector [10 . . . 0]
(set the bit with negative weight but clear all others), having integer value
TMinw .
= −2w−1. The greatest value is given by bit vector [01 . . . 1] (clear the bit
with negative weight but set all others), having integer value TMaxw .

i=0 2i =
2w−1 −1. Using the 4-bit case as an example, we have TMin4 = B2T4([1000]) =
−23 = −8 and TMax4 = B2T4([0111]) = 22 + 21 + 20 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.
We can see that B2Tw is a mapping of bit patterns of length w to numbers be-
tween TMinw and TMaxw, written as B2Tw: {0, 1}w →{TMinw, . . . , TMaxw}. As
we saw with the unsigned representation, every number within the representable
range has a unique encoding as a w-bit two’s-complement number. This leads to
a principle for two’s-complement numbers similar to that for unsigned numbers:
principle: Uniqueness of two’s-complement encoding
Function B2Tw is a bijection.
We deﬁne function T2Bw (for “two’s complement to binary”) to be the inverse
of B2Tw. That is, for a number x, such that TMinw ≤x ≤TMaxw, T2Bw(x) is the
(unique) w-bit pattern that encodes x.
Practice Problem 2.17 (solution page 184)
Assuming w = 4, we can assign a numeric value to each possible hexadecimal
digit, assuming either an unsigned or a two’s-complement interpretation. Fill in
the following table according to these interpretations by writing out the nonzero
powers of 2 in the summations shown in Equations 2.1 and 2.3:
