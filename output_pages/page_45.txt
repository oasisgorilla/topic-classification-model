hello executable
stored on disk
assumes that it is the name of an executable ﬁle that it should load and run. So
in this case, the shell loads and runs the hello program and then waits for it to
terminate.The hello programprintsitsmessagetothescreenandthenterminates.
The shell then prints a prompt and waits for the next input command line.
1.4.1
Hardware Organization of a System
To understand what happens to our hello program when we run it, we need
to understand the hardware organization of a typical system, which is shown
in Figure 1.4. This particular picture is modeled after the family of recent Intel
systems, but all systems have a similar look and feel. Don’t worry about the
complexity of this ﬁgure just now. We will get to its various details in stages
throughout the course of the book.
Buses
Running throughout the system is a collection of electrical conduits called buses
that carry bytes of information back and forth between the components. Buses
are typically designed to transfer ﬁxed-size chunks of bytes known as words. The
number of bytes in a word (the word size) is a fundamental system parameter that
varies across systems. Most machines today have word sizes of either 4 bytes (32
bits) or 8 bytes (64 bits). In this book, we do not assume any ﬁxed deﬁnition of
word size. Instead, we will specify what we mean by a “word” in any context that
requires this to be deﬁned.
