Part II
Running Programs
on a System
O
ur exploration of computer systems continues with a closer look
at the systems software that builds and runs application programs.
The linker combines different parts of our programs into a sin-
gle ﬁle that can be loaded into memory and executed by the processor.
Modern operating systems cooperate with the hardware to provide each
program with the illusion that it has exclusive use of a processor and the
main memory, when in reality multiple programs are running on the sys-
tem at any point in time.
In the ﬁrst part of this book, you developed a good understanding of
the interaction between your programs and the hardware. Part II of the
book will broaden your view of systems by giving you a solid understand-
ing of the interactions between your programs and the operating system.
You will learn how to use services provided by the operating system to
build system-level programs such as Unix shells and dynamic memory
allocation packages.
