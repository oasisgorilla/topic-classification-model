cylinders and tracks. Once you have that straight, just plug and chug:
Disk capacity = 1,024 bytes
sector
× 500 sectors
track
× 15,000 tracks
surface
× 2 surfaces
platter
× 3 platters
disk
= 46,080,000,000 bytes
= 46.08 GB
Solution to Problem 6.3 (page 631)
The solution to this problem is a straightforward application of the formula for
disk access time. The average rotational latency (in ms) is
Tavg rotation = 1/2 × Tmax rotation
= 1/2 × (60 secs/12,000 RPM) × 1,000 ms/sec
≈2.5 ms
The average transfer time is
Tavg transfer = (60 secs/12,000 RPM) × 1/300 sectors/track × 1,000 ms/sec
≈0.016 ms
Putting it all together, the total estimated access time is
Taccess = Tavg seek + Tavg rotation + Tavg transfer
= 5 ms + 2.5 ms + 0.016 ms
≈7.516 ms
Solution to Problem 6.4 (page 631)
This is a good check of your understanding of the factors that affect disk perfor-
mance. First we need to determine a few basic properties of the ﬁle and the disk.
The ﬁle consists of 10,000 512-byte logical blocks. For the disk, Tavg seek = 6 ms,
Tmax rotation = 4.61 ms, and Tavg rotation = 2.30 ms.
A. Best case: In the optimal case, the blocks are mapped to contiguous sectors,
on the same cylinder, that can be read one after the other without moving
the head. Once the head is positioned over the ﬁrst sector it takes two full
rotations (5,000 sectors per rotation) of the disk to read all 10,000 blocks.
So the total time to read the ﬁle is Tavg seek + Tavg rotation + 2 × Tmax rotation =
6 + 2.30 + 9.22 = 17.52 ms.
B. Random case: In this case, where blocks are mapped randomly to sectors,
reading each of the 10,000 blocks requires Tavg seek + Tavg rotation ms, so the
total time to read the ﬁle is (Tavg seek + Tavg rotation) × 10,000 = 83,000 ms
(83 seconds!).
You can see now why it’s often a good idea to defragment your disk drive!
