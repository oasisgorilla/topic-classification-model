Page fault exception handler

Figure 9.13
Operational view of page hits and page faults. VA: virtual address. PTEA:
page table entry address. PTE: page table entry. PA: physical address.
Step 7. The fault handler returns to the original process, causing the faulting
instruction to be restarted. The CPU resends the offending virtual address
to the MMU. Because the virtual page is now cached in physical memory,
there is a hit, and after the MMU performs the steps in Figure 9.13(a), the
main memory returns the requested word to the processor.
Practice Problem 9.3 (solution page 917)
Given a 64-bit virtual address space and a 32-bit physical address, determine the
number of bits in the VPN, VPO, PPN, and PPO for the following page sizes P:
