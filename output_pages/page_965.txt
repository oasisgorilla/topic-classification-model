Subset of the Internet domain name hierarchy.
At the next level are second-level domain names such as cmu.edu, which are
assigned on a ﬁrst-come ﬁrst-serve basis by various authorized agents of ICANN.
Once an organization has received a second-level domain name, then it is free to
create any other new domain name within its subdomain, such as cs.cmu.edu.
The Internet deﬁnes a mapping between the set of domain names and the
set of IP addresses. Until 1988, this mapping was maintained manually in a sin-
gle text ﬁle called HOSTS.TXT. Since then, the mapping has been maintained in a
distributed worldwide database known as DNS (Domain Name System). Concep-
tually, the DNS database consists of millions of host entries, each of which deﬁnes
the mapping between a set of domain names and a set of IP addresses. In a math-
ematical sense, think of each host entry as an equivalence class of domain names
and IP addresses. We can explore some of the properties of the DNS mappings
with the Linux nslookup program, which displays the IP addresses associated with
a domain name.1
Each Internet host has the locally deﬁned domain name localhost, which
always maps to the loopback address 127.0.0.1:
linux> nslookup localhost
Address: 127.0.0.1
The localhost name provides a convenient and portable way to reference clients
and servers that are running on the same machine, which can be especially useful
1. We’ve reformatted the output of nslookup to improve readability.
