Given the assumptions in Problem 6.38, determine the cache performance of the
following code:
1
for (i = 15; i >= 0; i--) {
2
for (j = 15; j >= 0; j--) {
3
square[i][j].y = 1;
4
}
5
}
6
for (i = 15; i >= 0; i--) {
7
for (j = 15; j >= 0; j--) {
8
square[i][j].c = 0;
9
square[i][j].m = 0;
10
square[i][j].k = 0;
11
}
12
}
A. What is the total number of writes?
B. What is the total number of writes that hit in the cache?
C. What is the hit rate?

You are writing a new 3D game that you hope will earn you fame and fortune. You
are currently working on a function to blank the screen buffer before drawing the
next frame. The screen you are working with is a 640 × 480 array of pixels. The
machine you are working on has a 32 KB direct-mapped cache with 8-byte lines.
The C structures you are using are as follows:
1
struct pixel {
2
char r;
3
char g;
4
char b;
5
char a;
6
};
7
8
struct pixel buffer[480][640];
9
int i, j;
10
char *cptr;
11
int *iptr;
Assume the following:
. sizeof(char) = 1 and sizeof(int) = 4.
