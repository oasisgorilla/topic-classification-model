Why set the bias this way for denormalized values?
Having the exponent value be 1 −Bias rather than simply −Bias might seem counterintuitive. We will
see shortly that it provides for smooth transition from denormalized to normalized values.

binary point to the left of the most signiﬁcant bit. The signiﬁcand is deﬁned to be
M = 1 + f . This is sometimes called an implied leading 1 representation, because
we can view M to be the number with binary representation 1.fn−1fn−2 . . . f0. This
representation is a trick for getting an additional bit of precision for free, since we
can always adjust the exponent E so that signiﬁcand M is in the range 1 ≤M < 2
(assuming there is no overﬂow). We therefore do not need to explicitly represent
the leading bit, since it always equals 1.
Case 2: Denormalized Values
When the exponent ﬁeld is all zeros, the represented number is in denormalized
form. In this case, the exponent value is E = 1 −Bias, and the signiﬁcand value is
M = f , that is, the value of the fraction ﬁeld without an implied leading 1.
Denormalized numbers serve two purposes. First, they provide a way to
represent numeric value 0, since with a normalized number we must always have
M ≥1, and hence we cannot represent 0. In fact, the ﬂoating-point representation
of +0.0 has a bit pattern of all zeros: the sign bit is 0, the exponent ﬁeld is all
zeros (indicating a denormalized value), and the fraction ﬁeld is all zeros, giving
M = f = 0. Curiously, when the sign bit is 1, but the other ﬁelds are all zeros, we
get the value −0.0. With IEEE ﬂoating-point format, the values −0.0 and +0.0
are considered different in some ways and the same in others.
